-   The data structure you plan to use.
    - 'The data structure I plan to use will at a high level be an array of possible winning positions and then to compare where each of the players are at after their move and if they have a possible winnig position then they will recieve the win'
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    - 'the game board will be an array and have 9 indexed positions from top left to bottom right of the board'
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    - 'I plan to approach this project one Most Viable Product implementation at a time and to commit early and often'
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    - As a player, I want to be able to sign-up so that I can play under my username and against other players
    - As a player, I want to be able to login so that I can come back anytime and be able to play under my username and other players.
    - As a player, I want to be able to logout so that I can terminate my session and let the other player i dont want to play anymore.
    - As a player, I want to be able to update my password so that I can keep the security.
    - As a player, I want to be able to see whose turn it is so that I can keep track of when to play.
    - As a player, I want to be able to see what the game win count is for both players so that I can keep track of who is winning.
    - As a player, I want to be able to play the game with no issues so that I can have fun.
    As a player, I want to be able to start a new game when one game ends so that I can continue to play the game.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    - 'Seperation of concerns. I plan to keep all like code in the same place and seperate out anycode that would be easier to debug if it were in a seperate file.'
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    - 'I was hoping to maybe be able to change the password in the pre-login area if a user forgets (if the API will allow me to do so). As well as have the Login screen have a swipe type animation over to the sign-up page if you click that link. Then maybe some audible winning music or alert'
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    - I will be version controlling with git and be commiting early and often.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    - 'Oh hell yeah. Im really excited to hopefully make it so that you can play with seperate devices with people from anywhere.'
